          ðŸš€ Innovate with Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT)!

        <Typography variant="subtitle1" align="center">
          Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT) is a structured methodology for
          creativity, innovation, and problem-solving, developed in Israel in
          the mid-1990s. Rooted in the principles of TRIZ (Theory of Inventive
          Problem Solving), SIT operates on the premise that inventive solutions
          share common patterns. By identifying and applying these patterns,
          individuals and organizations can systematically generate innovative
          ideas and solutions.

            <Typography variant="body1">
              SIT is a practical approach to creativity, innovation, and
              problem-solving, which has become a well-known methodology for
              innovation. At the heart of SIT's method is one core idea adopted
              from Genrich Altshuller's TRIZ: that inventive solutions share
              common patterns. Focusing not on what makes inventive solutions
              different, but on what they share in common, is core to SIT's
              approach.
