          TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) is a powerful innovation
          methodology created by Genrich Altshuller. It helps you systematically
          solve problems and develop creative solutions by learning from past
          innovations.

            <Typography>
              Innovation arises from solving contradictions between two
              competing requirements. Instead of compromising, TRIZ provides
              techniques to overcome these contradictions elegantly. The
              Contradiction Matrix, often used in TRIZ, helps innovators match
              specific contradictions to effective inventive principles.
